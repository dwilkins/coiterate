# coiterate

## I'm not sure how we're gonna do it

But I'd like to clone Trello, but with a bent towards a sitemap instead of cards and lists

 * Organize the cards like a sitemap
 * Integrate with Jenkins and tests somehow
 * Calculate some metrics about who's committed code that affects a page
 * Calculate some metrics about how many problems have been associated with a page
 * other cool stuff
